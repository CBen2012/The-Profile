<h1>My Profile</h1>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<h4>
<p>My name is Campbell Bennett; student number is s3841068. My email address is s3841068@student.rmit.edu.au. I am 18 years old and I have lived in Melbourne, Victoria, my entire life. I went to Brighton Secondary College, at which I graduated in 2019.</p>
<p>I grew up in a family of four with my two parents and my brother. I am a big fan of both watching and playing sports, especially basketball. I often go to the park across the road to have a kick of the footy or shoot around with my brother and father. </p>
<p>I also have a pet cat named Pepper. I really enjoy playing video games with friends. I mostly play Rainbow Six Siege or NBA 2K on the PS4.</p>
</h4>
<h2>Interests in IT</h2>
<h4>
<p>My interest in IT as a career path started in 2016. Shortly after I purchased the PlayStation in April, I was interested as to how it worked. I remember going to a friend’s place to open his up and have a look inside. It was cool to see the different components and the connections between them. Around a year later, we purchased the parts to build our own PC. This captured my interest as we were able to successfully put it together first try.</p>
<p>I originally started an engineering course at RMIT at the beginning of 2020, however shortly after it began I decided engineering was not for me. I then turned my eyes towards the IT side of technology. I chose to stay at RMIT and applied for the Bachelor of Information Technology program. </p>

</p>
<p>A game developer works in a development team for a video game company. The team works together to build features such at level design, story, sound etc. in order to make a complete, playable product.</p>
<p>As I have played and enjoyed video game throughout majority of my life, I would love to work for a development company knowing that the game I am working on is providing people with some enjoyment in their down time.</p>
<p>A game developer would require high-level skills in coding and design, as well as mental skills such as problem solving to deal with any errors. This would go along with a qualification from either an IT course or a more specific game development course. The level of experience required would depend on the company. For example, a position at Ubisoft, Epic Games or Take-Two Interactive would require experience of more than ten years. However, a position at a lower level company would require a lot less.</p>
<p>I am just starting the Bachelor of Information Technology program at RMIT, in which I can hopefully learn and develop skills in coding. I hope that, at the end of the course, I would find a job at a low-level development company. In this position, I can gather experience while increasing my skill level with the hope of finding a job at one of the larger companies.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<h4>
<p>My result for a Myers-Briggs online test is that I am an ISTP. This means that I am Introverted, Sensing, Thinking and Perceiving. I see myself as an introvert who is very logical, outlined by this test. I usually become a lot more outgoing once I get to know someone a bit better and I am comfortable around him or her. This means I would require some time working as a group in order to work at my best in a team environment.</p>
<p>The results of a learning style test showed that I am a 35% auditory learner, a 30% visual learner, and a 35% tactile learner. This means I learn relatively evenly through any form of information. This would help in a team environment, as I am likely to be able to pick up information quickly in any context.</p>
<p>My result for a creativity test is 37.95. The average is 63.11. This demonstrates what I would have thought which is that I am not very creative. I am better off building what other people design rather than designing it myself. This would require a lot more teamwork in a group environment.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3>
<p>Overview</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p>My idea would be a first-person aim trainer game designed to help players warm up before they play their respective games. This would have many different modes such as a target shooter, moving characters and a target tracker, along with features such as recoil. The game would also include a range of sight options and an adjustable sensitivity to ensure players can receive an experience similar to the games they play. The game could also keep track of stats such as targets hit in 30 seconds, to help people track their improvement. This would make a great option for people to warm up before jumping in to their game.</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p>Motivation</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p>Many first person shooter games do not have an aim trainer or shooting range within the game. This is usually to improve other features while keeping disc space down. This means players need to look elsewhere in order to warm up successfully. From personal experience, trying to warm up by playing online can be frustrating as if you lose the first gunfight you need to wait for the next round or match to play again in many games. An aim trainer means that you cannot die, and can continue practicing until you feel warm.</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p>Description</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p>This program would be available on PC, however, along with mouse and keyboard, would also include controller support for console players.</p>
<p>For all game modes, the user is in a small area, around 3m across and 2m back. The player is free to move around as well as being able crouch up and down. The player is to look forward where there is an opening, 3m across and 3m tall, towards the target area in front of them. The targets appear in this area.</p>
<p>The main mode is a flick aim trainer, where targets appear randomly within the target area for 30 seconds. The next target appears when the previous one is shot. This trains the player reactions and ability to flick to a new target. The game records the number of targets shot within the time limit, and the high score and average is calculated and displayed to the user.</p> 
<p>Another mode is a track aim trainer, where the target moves in straight lines in a 2D plane, changing directions at random for 30 seconds. The player must keep their crosshair on the target for as long as possible. The player’s score is the time spent on the target.</p>
<p>The third mode has NPCs (Non Player Characters) which run across the screen at a random distance away from the user. Each character requires five shots to kill. The player also has the choice between fully automatic and semi-automatic. Full automatic means the player can hold shoot and the gun will rapid fire, while semi-automatic means the player must continuously click to shoot. This ensures players must control the recoil or tap fire while tracking the moving target. As soon as one NPC dies or reaches the end of he screen, another begins to cross the screen. The score is the number of NPCs killed, and the high score and averages are calculated and displayed.</p>
<p>In terms of the available sights, the player can choose between a reflex sight and a telescopic sight. The reflex sight has an option between a dot or a holographic sight for the crosshair and a choice of colour between red, green and blue. The telescopic sight has a 2.5x zoom available, along with the ACOG crosshair. This is only available in red. </p>
<p>In the settings menu, the player will have access to a separate horizontal and vertical sensitivity, as well as basic volume controls. They will also be able to map inputs to different keys or buttons to allow for a more accurate experience to their primary game.</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p>Tools and Technologies</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p>The game software required is a game design program such as unity. This would allow me to add in the different modes and input the user’s character and the targets. This program can also store scores in order to highlight players’ progress within each different mode.</p>
<p>I would also need 2D and 3D design software to draft and then finalise the menus, the training and target area, the targets, including the NPCs, and the sights. This would be necessary to ensure that the menus are all aesthetically pleasing and that there is a good contrast between the targets and the walls.</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p>Skills Required</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p>I would require skills in programming and coding in order to program the way the targets either spawn or move and how they interact with the curser. I would also need the skills to implement a score tracking system, an average calculator and a stopwatch.</p>
<p>I would also require skills in design in order to produce menus that look clean and enticing. I would also need to design the characters and sights, which are accurate to their real counterparts, as well as the target area and the targets themselves.</p>
</h4>
<h3>
<p>Outcome</p>
</h3>
<h4>
<p>If this program is successful, it will act as a viable option for gamers to utilise as a warm up tool. It would greatly decrease the time taken to achieve optimum aim levels, as the player does not need to worry about dying and waiting for the next game or round to start. This ensures players are playing at their highest capability as soon as they jump in to their competitive online game.</p>
<p>Ideally, the game would run smoothly with little to no input delay, without freezing or lagging and without any drops in frame rate. This would increase the usability of the program, enticing the players to continue using it and possibly sharing it, spreading its popularity.</p>
